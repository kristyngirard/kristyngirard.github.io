		<em><strong>Who I Am: </strong></em><br><br>
		
		Computer Science honours student looking for a full-time software development position after my 
		graduation from Carleton University in June 2015<br><br>
		
		<em><strong>Why I entered the field of CS: </strong></em><br><br>
		
		In the beginning, I had no idea what computer science even meant. As a high school student, I enjoyed math and
		sciences, but my school didn't offer any programming courses. I was at a crossroads when choosing what to major in for 
		university until my mom, a computer programmer for the federal government, encouraged me to try out a degree in
		computer science. I was nervous about going in without any previous experience (and boy, was that first semester 
		a real challenge!), but after learning the basic principles and syntax, I grew more comfortable with programming
		and now I can't imagine a life without code!
